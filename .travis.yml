  # update is required to update the repositories to see the new packages for

  - curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  - sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

  # Print out the current docker-compose version. Once this reports 1.6+ then we
  # do not need the following steps.
  - docker-compose --version

  # As of the writing of this script Travis has docker-compose v1.4.2, we need
  # to update it to 1.19+. $DOCKER_COMPOSE_VERSION is provide from the `env`
  # above.
  - sudo rm /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

  - chmod +x docker-compose
  - sudo mv docker-compose /usr/local/bin

  # Check that docker-compose is now running the latest version (or at least the
  # one we specified). This is not to be confused with the version we printed
  # before doing the update.
  - docker-compose --version

  # Setup your application stack. You may need to tweak these commands if you
  # doing out-of-the-ordinary docker-compose builds.
  - docker-compose build
  - docker-compose up -d

  # You will want this for logging. If one of your containers does not build for
  # whatever reason it's best to report that now before your tests start
  # otherwise it can be really tricky to debug why tests are failing sometimes.
